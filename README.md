# Source Load Apportionment Model in Python (SLAMpy)
The Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM), developed by Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), estimates the phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) loads that reach a river from all major sources in a sub-catchment e.g. agriculture, forestry and industry. 

SLAMpy is the implementation of SLAM in Python. SLAMpy can both be used as an ArcMap Toolbox and as a Python package with its Application Programming Interface (API).

*Disclaimer:* SLAM makes use of national datasets available for Ireland and, therefore, it is only readily applicable to an Irish context.
